END COVID NOW!

Welcome to your Covid Informational Guide, your guide to all things Covid-19.

Here, (localhost:9000/), the user is redirected to the landing page. 

From the landing page, the user can click on "Click Here". This will bring the user to the main page.

On the main page, the user can click on either of the four buttons: "Products", "Testing", "Vaccine", and "Covid Traking". Clicking on one of these buttons redirects the user to another page. 

When directed to the "Products" tab, the user will be redirected to the 'Products' page where he or she can view different products that aid in the protection against Covid. The user can view the different product's average pricing based on three different stores that each product can be found in and each product's average efficiency. 

When directed to the "Testing" tab, the user will be redirected to the 'Testing' page where he or she can view different forms of testing that can detect whether a person has Covid-19 or not. The user can also find information about where to get each testing done.

When directed to the "Vaccine" tab, the user will be redirected to the 'Vaccine' page where he or she can view information about the upcoming vaccine by Pfizer. 

And finally, when directed to the "Covid Tracking" tab, the user will be redirected to the 'Covid Tracking' page where he or she can view the projected Covid-19 tracking data in the United States from the beginning of this year.

On each separate page, there are three tabs that the user can click on: "Update", "Delete", and "Add a Product". 

"Update" will allow the user to update information such as updating the average efficiency of a product in the products section. 

"Delete" will allow the user to delete information that is no longer relevent like data on the 'Covid Tracking' page that occurred pre-Covid.

Finally, "Add a Product" allows the user to create new information because as we know, our information about Covid is forever changing!

At the bottom of the main page, there is a "Subscibe" button and next to the button is a form that the user can enter their email address. When the user clicks the "Subscribe" button, an alert will pop up on the screen saying, "Thanks for Subscribing!"
